                <q>Information and communications technology <abbr title="Information and communications technology">(ICT)</abbr></q> is an extensional term for <q>information technology <abbr title="Information technology">(IT)</abbr></q> that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage, and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate information.[2]
<br><br>
                The term <abbr title="Information and communications technology">ICT</abbr> is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. <cite><abbr title="Information and communcications technology">ICT</abbr> is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliance with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.[3]</cite>
<br><br>
                <abbr title="Information and communications technology">ICT</abbr> is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving.[4] It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers, digital television, email, or robots). Theoretical differences between interpersonal-communication technologies and mass-communication technologies have been identified by the philosopher Piyush Mathur.[5] <q>Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals for the 21st century.[6]</q>

<hr>
            <p>
                The phrase <abbr title="ICT">"information and communication technologies"</abbr> has been used by academic researchers since the 1980s.[7] The abbreviation <abbr title="Information and communications technology">"ICT" </abbr> became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in 1997,[8] and then in the revised National Curriculum for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000. However, in 2012, the Royal Society recommended that the use of the term "ICT" should be discontinued in British schools "as it has attracted too many negative connotations".[9] From 2014 the National Curriculum has used the word computing, which reflects the addition of computer programming into the curriculum.[10]
<br><br>
                Variations of the phrase have spread worldwide. The United Nations has created a <abbr title="UN">"United Nations</abbr> Information and Communication Technologies Task Force" and an internal "Office of Information and Communications Technology".[11]

                The money spent on <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> worldwide has been estimated as US$3.8 trillion [12] in 2017 and has been growing at less than 5% per year since 2009. The estimate 2018 growth of the entire <abbr title="Information and communications technology">ICT</abbr> is 5%. The biggest growth of 16% is expected in the area of new technologies (IoT, Robotics, AR/VR, and AI).[13]
<br><br>
                The 2014 IT budget of US federal government was nearly $82 billion.[14] IT costs, as a percentage of corporate revenue, have grown 50% since 2002, putting a strain on IT budgets. When looking at current companies' IT budgets, 75% are recurrent costs, used to "keep the lights on" in the IT department, and 25% are cost of new initiatives for technology development.[15]
<br><br>
                The average <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> budget has the following breakdown:[15]
                <ul>
                    <li>31% personnel costs (internal)</li>
                    <li>29% software costs (external/purchasing category)</li>
                    <li>26% hardware costs (external/purchasing category)</li>
                    <li>14% costs of external service providers (external/services).</li>
                </ul>
                The estimate of money to be spent in 2022 is just over US$6 trillion.[16]

                <q>The world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, and some 5 zetta bytes in 2014.</q>[17][18] This is the informational equivalent to 1.25 stacks of CD-ROM from the earth to the moon in 2007, and the equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the earth to the sun in 2014.

                The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1.2 (optimally compressed) zettabytes in 2000, and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007.[17] The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007,[17] and some 100 exabytes in 2014.[19] <q>The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 Ã— 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007.</q>[17]
